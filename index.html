            <h1>What is DDDC?</h1>
            Doki Doki Date Club! is a mod for Doki DOki Literature Club designed with the intention of providing
            an experience more in line with traditional romance visual novels like Katawa Shoujo. The mod will
            have a story branch for each of the four girls that will expand their backstories and personalities, giving
            you the chance to spend more time with your favourite club member! The path to love and literature
            wont be an easy one, though. Will you write the into her heart, or will you break it?
